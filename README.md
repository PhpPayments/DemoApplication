# PHP Payments Library Demo Application

This is a demonstration application of the php payments library. It is not thought to be used in any way with real money transaction or to be used as a live site or product.

Use it for testing the php payments lib payment provider implementation only!

## Setup

 * Configure a vhost, for example http://paymentsdemo.local and set the webroot to the demo folder, make sure it is available from the outside so that payment providers that do callbacks can reach your vhost. You can use your ip or set up something like dyndns.
 * Make sure the PhpPayment lib is auto loaded
